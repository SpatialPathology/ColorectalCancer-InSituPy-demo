## 🚀 Features

- Loading and exploring Xenium In Situ spatial transcriptomics data
- Preprocessing and quality control
- Spatial clustering and cell-type annotation
- Visualization of spatial gene expression patterns
- Demonstration of InSituPy's core functionalities

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run the demo notebooks, InSituPy has to be installed. For information on how to install it, see [here](https://github.com/SpatialPathology/InSituPy?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

The data can be downloaded from [GEO]() and needs to be placed in the `data/` directory.

> 📦 **Note:** The Xenium output files on GEO are provided as `.tar.gz` archives. These must be extracted before use.

## 📊 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jwrth/colorectalcancer-insitupy-demo.git
   cd colorectalcancer-insitupy-demo
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Lab or Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

3. Open the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder and follow along.
